## Local Development

If you want to edit your website on your own computer rather than at GitHub.com, follow these instructions.

1. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
2. Clone down your fork: `git clone https://github.com/myname/myname.github.io.git`.
3. Serve the site locally on your computer: `jekyll serve`.
4. View your website at http://127.0.0.1:4000/.
5. Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository: `git commit -m "message here"`; then `git push -u origin master`. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website publicly.
