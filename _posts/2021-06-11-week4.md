title: Week 4 June 7 - 11, 2021
---

This week is to focus on method section of our research paper. I actually enjoyed this part because to me, it is like a outline which I loved! The outline of our method study is to father 20 people and then interview them using our WebRTC. Before I dig deeper on our method section, on Monday and Tuesday I felt like it was a slow day because Sam and I felt we did not know where to go after literature review. Actually, we did little more editing on our literature review. It is not 100% done due to some content and our APA footnotes but the overall concept is pretty done. I am sure we will always go back to it at end of our term to double check it. 

After we were done with literature review, we were waiting on our mentors to share the codes with us so that we can start setting up our demo for interview. There were issues with VPN from Gallaudet, so it took couple days to figure it out.  But that was part was more for Sam. I am the more of people person and person to search solutions for Sam to coded it up. ðŸ˜Š I had demographics all set up and Sam helped me set up more. I then also set up the inform consent page by looking at Joey and Ramzyâ€™s form. I also Google the template for it. That is the starting content for our Inform consent. Our mentor, Katja and Raja finally shared their folder of what was their IRB (Institutional Review Board)â€™s requirements. I looked at their templates and realized some of their content is similar to mine. So of course, I edited some and add more. I also add few more for our folder just in case. I hope our study get approved. 

I am looking forward to stat interview but apparently it wonâ€™t start until after 6th week I believe. It could be start earlier if we got approved and did our pilot study. I think maybe on Wednesday we will do pilot of our study and get some idea of how long our study will be. Today, Raja said he hope many of us can finish have three things, our resume, our questionaries, and our inform consent. All of that was done. Sam focused on testing the ManyCam program (I join and played too!). We were experimenting on if it was possible to play pre-recording video while WebRTC with user. It was working and the captions was working too. So, it is feasible to use it. 

Anyway, this week was not so bad, and I am looking forward to next week where we bucked down and start doing pilot study and see where we can improve in areas. Also looking forward to doing some UI changes in our WebRTC with Sam. Our study required 20 people to interview and then test our demo with them. Get their feedback and report our results based on that. If we have time, maybe we will make adjustment to our WebRTC and do another quick interview with same group to see if our new improvement is better. Who know what would lead us in future.
