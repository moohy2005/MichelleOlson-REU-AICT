First week of internship is new and odd. I just finish my spring semester at RIT. and flew to my parent's new house on Friday. i only have the weekend off to get myself all settled. The Wifi in my parents' home are not that great. :/ Nonetheless, I went forward and roll up my sleeves, ready to work! Today is Friday and I look forward to work as week goes by. I had done research paper before but in classroom setting and not professionally done. So this is first for me as professional research paper.
